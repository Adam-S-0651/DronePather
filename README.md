This is team members Adam Smith and Nicholas Sardinia's final project for DSA comparing Dijkstra's and A*

The project is able to run 100000 nodes for both algorithms, however due to the randomly generated nature of graph generation, it is best to only have one edge connecting the nodes for the code to run in a reasonable time frame. It will generate with more edges, but how long it takes increases exponentially.
